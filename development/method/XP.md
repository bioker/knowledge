## Fine scale feedback

### Test driven development

+ Most used types of test
    + Unit tests
        + Test is created before real code
        + In the beginning all new tests are fallen
            + It allow us to be sure that tests are workable
        + Tests help to realize how code need to be used
        + Tests allow to perform refactoring without risk 
            to break existed functional
    + Acceptance tests
        + Help to check that the requirements is performed
