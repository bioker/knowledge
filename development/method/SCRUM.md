    in the short development cycle named *Sprint*
    + Set of functionality for sprint is determined by priority of each one
    + Set of functionality for sprint doesn't change during sprint

+ *Sprint* - iteration of development process which provides new functionality
    + Time for *Sprint* is fixed (variates between 2 to 4 weeks)
    + The shorter time of the *Sprint* the more agile process of development
