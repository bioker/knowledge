    + Responding to change over following a plan
+ Principles
    + Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
    + Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
    + Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
    + Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
    + Projects are built around motivated individuals who should be trusted
    + Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication
    + Working software is the primary measure of progress
    + Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
    + Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    + Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential
    + Best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams
    + Regulary, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
