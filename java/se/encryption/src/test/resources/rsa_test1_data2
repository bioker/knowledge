A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers,
along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key
to encrypt a message, but with currently published methods, if the public key is large enough,
only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can feasibly decode the message. Breaking RSA
encryption is known as the RSA problem; whether it is as hard as the factoring problem remains an open question.

RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, and because of this it is less commonly used to directly encrypt user data.
More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key cryptography which in turn can
perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much higher speed.
