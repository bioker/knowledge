## [Introduction](INTRO.md)

## Classification

### Brute force

+ Sequentially check all possible solutions

### Action and conquer

+ Sequentially apply some action to simplify 
    input on each iteration

### Dynamic programming

+ Memorize previous computation that can 
    be used in next iteration optimizing 
    time (space on time trade-off)

### Greedy algorithm

+ Choose optimal choise on each iteration with 
    the intent to finding a global optimum
