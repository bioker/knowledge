## Preface

+ What makes Pragmatic Programmer
    + Some Pragmatic Programmer Characteristics
        + Early adopter / Fast adapter
            + Possibility to use new technologies and 
                make it quickly and quality
        + Inquisitive
            + Be interested in adjacent technologies
        + Critical thinker
            + Be believed to facts and not to words
        + Realistic
            + Try to understand all underlying problems
                and make decision base on it
        + Jack of all trades
            + Try hard to be familiar with broad range
                of technologies, environments and tools
    + Care about your craft
    + Think about your work
+ Take Responsibility
    + The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak
        + Take responsibility for yourself and your actions
    + Provide options, don't make lame excuses
+ Big troubles grows from small ones
    + If a one broken window don't repaired long time,
        then people will think that building is probably abandoned,
        then, for example, graffiti, damage, can appears there
        and in the end, building will be real abandoned
    + Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions or poor code)
        resolve it as soon as possible or, if it's impossible,
        make it explicit for further work
+ If you have pretty clean project with elegant written code and so on,
    don't forget that one day probably it will be necessary to break
    something because of time limits

+ Be a catalyst of change
    + Soldiers, villagers and stone soup story

+ Remember a big picture
    + Often It can be necessary for decision 
        whether task we are going to do is necessary

+ Frog problem
    + If you'll throw frog to boiling water then it'll jump out 
        but if you'll put it when water is still cold, after 
        that you'll start to boil the water, frog will sit there 
        adapting to temperature and at the end it will die
    + Don't be like the frog, look around

+ Good-Enough Software
    + Striving to better, oft we mar what's well
+ Involve your users in the trade off
    + Do you ask them about how good your feature?
    + Make Quality a Requirements Issue
    + When you're gonna allow your users to use 
        your product you're gonna get feedback and real 
        demands for further work
+ Know When to Stop
    + Don't spoil good enough program by
        over embellishment and over refinement
+ An investment in knowledge always pays best interests
    + Principles is similar to managing financial portfolio:
        + Serious investors invest regularly - as a habit
        + Diversification is the key to long-term success
        + Smart investors balance their portfolios between
            convservative and high-risk, high-reward investments
        + Investors try to by low and sell high for maximum return
        + Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically
