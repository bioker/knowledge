## Spring is

+ Framework to make:
    + Java modules with low cohesion
    + Popular frameworks and library integration simple
+ Based on:
    + Inversion of Control principle
        + Hollywood Principle - Don't call us we'll call you 
        + Each program module knows as less as it can about other ones
        + In best case all will depend from abstractions
        + Control of program flow is delegated to special module - IoC container
    + Dependency Injection
        + Implementation of IoC
        + Each module has dependencies, Spring control injection 
            of these dependencies at runtime

## Spring advantages

+ Ready solutions for common tasks in Java applications development
